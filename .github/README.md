A modern revival of the classic Vending Block mod, bringing back simple player-to-player trading from Minecraft's early days. Set up vendors that allow players to trade with each other even when offline, staying faithful to AUTOMATIC\_MAIDEN's (aka [minecreatr](https://www.curseforge.com/members/minecreatr/projects)) original 1.6.4 mod while adding modernized quality-of-life features.

---

### **Features**

*   **Simple Player Trading**: Set up a vendor and start trading! No need to meet up to trade.
*   **Offline Trading**: Players can use your vendors whenever the world is online, even if you're not.
*   **Transaction Info**: Looking at a vendor shows you what's for sale.
*   **Endless Customization**: Change the texture of the vendor's base directly in the GUI.
*   **Notifications**: Vendors will notify you of transactions and issues (toggleable).
*   **Animations**: Choose from different display animations for the item showcase.
*   **Display Block**: A new block dedicated to showing off your items!

### **Admin Features**

*   **Server-Wide Animation**: Set the default display animation for all players on your server. (Players can override this setting in their client config if desired.)
*   **Blacklisting**: Prevent the sale of specific items and restrict certain facade blocks through the server config.
*   **Server Admin Screen**: Access special vendor management tools using the Vendor's Key:
    *   **_Owner Changing_**: Reassign vendor ownership (useful when players change usernames or for creating server-run shops).
    *   **_Infinite Inventory_**: Enable unlimited stock for any vendor.
    *   **_Payment Discarding_**: Automatically void incoming payment items instead of storing them.
*   **Remove Key from Creative**: Hide the Vendor's Key from the Creative menu to prevent unauthorized access.

### **Compatibility**

*   **REI/JEI/EMI**: Drag and drop from the item list to set prices and facades.
*   **Jade**: Transaction information displays through Jade's overlay system.
*   **Shaders**: Fully compatible. Tested with _Photon_.
*   **Resource Packs**: Vendor facades pull textures directly from active resource packs. Tested with _Bare Bones_ and _Bare Metals_.
*   **Every Mod**: Use blocks from any mod as vendor facades. Tested with _Biomes O' Plenty_.

### **Issue Tracker**

This is my first mod! Bugs are to be expected, but I tested as much as I could think of. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Furglitch/vending-block/issues).
