> $${\color{red}State \space of \space Development}$$<br/>
> Currently, the mod is undergoing a complete rewrite, utilizing the Architectury API to add Fabric support. I'm also *considering* developing for some previous versions of Minecraft, at the very least 1.20.X.<br/>
> The rewrite will be handled in the [architectury-rewrite](https://github.com/Furglitch/vending-block/tree/architectury-rewrite) branch.<br/>
> Current issues will be addressed in the rewrite, unless severe enough to warrant immediate attention.

A modern revival of Vending Block from back when Minecraft versions were in the single-digits! Once again, players have a simple way to trade with each other, even when they're not online!
<br/>
<br/>
This mod aims to stay faithful to AUTOMATIC_MAIDEN's (aka <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/minecreatr/projects">minecreatr</a>) original 1.6.4 mod while adding a few modernized quality-of-life features!

### Features:
- **Simple Player Trading**: Set up a vendor and you're good to go! No need to meet up with people to trade.
- **Offline Trading**: No need to be online either! Players can use your vendors whenever the world is online!
- **Transaction Info**: Looking at a vendor shows you what's for sale.
- **Endless Customization**: Change the texture of the base in the GUI!
- **Notifications**: Vendors will notify you of transactions and issues (toggleable).
- **Animations**: Different animations are available for the item display.
- **Display Block**: A new block for showing off your items!

### Admin Features:
- **Server-Wide Animation**: Set the default display animation for your server! (Players can override this in their client config.)
- **Blacklisting**: Server admins can blacklist the sale of certain items with the server config, as well as the use of certain facades.
- **Server Admin Screen**: Using the Vendor's Key, you can access the following enhancements:
  - ***Owner Changing***: Change the owner of a vending block. (For when a player changes their username, or set it to your server name for a server shop)
  - ***Infinite Inventory***: Give your vendor block an endless stock.
  - ***Payment Discarding***: Don't need the items? Send them to the void.
- **Remove Key from Creative**: Simply removes the Vendor's Key from the Creative menu.

### Compatibility:
- **REI/JEI/EMI**: Set your prices and facade with a simple drag-and-drop from the item list.
- **Jade**: Favors the Jade overlay to show transaction information.
- **Compatible with Shaders:** Tested with *Photon*
- **Compatible with Resource Packs**: Pulls textures right from the block! Tested with *Bare Bones* and *Bare Metals*
- **Every Mod**: The base facade function accepts blocks from any mod! Tested with *Biomes O' Plenty*

This is my first mod! Bugs are to be expected, but I tested as much as I could think of.
