A modern revival of Vending Block from back when Minecraft versions were in the single-digits! Once again, players have a simple way to trade with each other, even when they're not online!
<br/>
<br/>
This mod aims to stay faithful to AUTOMATIC_MAIDEN's (aka [minecreatr](https://www.curseforge.com/members/minecreatr/projects) original 1.6.4 mod while adding a few modernized quality-of-life features!

### Features:
- **Simple Player Trading**: Set up a vendor and you're good to go! No need to meet up with people to trade.
- **Offline Trading**: No need to be online either! Players can use your vendors whenever the world is online!
- **Transaction Info**: Looking at a vendor shows you what's for sale.
- **Endless Customization**: Change the texture of the base in the GUI!
- **Notifications**: Vendors will notify you of transactions and issues (toggleable).
- **Animations**: Different animations are available for the item display.
- **Blacklisting**: Server admins can blacklist the sale of certain items with the server config.

### Mod Compatibility:
- **REI/JEI/EMI**: Set your prices and facade with a simple drag-and-drop from the item list.
- **Jade**: Favors the Jade overlay to show transaction information.

This is my first mod! Bugs are to be expected, but I tested as much as I could think of.
